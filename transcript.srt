1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,320
ladies and gentlemen if you clicked on

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,480
this video I've got a very simple

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,080
message for you every single one of you

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,120
should try to be as strong as possible

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,440
at the game of chess and the reason for

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,880
that is very simple absolutely every

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,039
other person that you interact with will

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,160
respect you much more every other person

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,760
that you interact with will think that

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,960
you are an intellectual a sophisticated

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,759
form of human being now not that is

12
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,320
Justified but the game of chess is

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,399
falsely associated with intelligence and

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,800
the lowest form of this intelligence or

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,960
capability is 100 ELO the lowest

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,360
possible form of chest strength that a

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,480
person can

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,399
have and in today's video I will show

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,640
you a chess game played between two

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,480
individuals in the ELO range of

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,920
100 but one

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,280
caveat we all have to start somewhere

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,680
all of us have started Chess at some

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,720
point at a certain location on the

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,600
rating

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,840
scale this is a new subscriber by the

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,520
name of Joe everybody say hi Joe he

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,880
didn't hear you because that's not the

29
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,520
way the internet works but Joe will

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,119
definitely get a warm big welcome on

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,439
this channel what we do on this channel

32
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,880
what we do in this playlist called how

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,680
to lose a chess is we break games down

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,280
and the point is that we're not laughing

35
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,920
at Joe or his

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,560
opponent we are looking at a mirror

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,479
image reflection of ourselves see chz

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,240
has this way of exposing all of our

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,000
flaws of exposing our of exposing our

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
hubris our arrogance our lack of empathy

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
for other people we all need to look at

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,840
the mirror and remember get as strong as

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,200
possible in chess because everybody will

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
think more highly of you shout out to

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,479
Joe for being brave enough to submit

46
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:50,079
this game let's break it down it is

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,799
187 versus 166 and Joe's opponent from

48
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,920
Austria named 16t has like a as a like a

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,840
James Bond name he just the name is just

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
is James Bond here we go Joe begins with

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,960
E4 already a very good move we don't

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,799
have to wait long to get the action bang

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,840
in here 16t responds with Pawn to

54
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,000
F5 a very strong move all right Joe

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,160
plays

56
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,200
D3 that's fine you know he spent a

57
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,920
little bit of time on that move D3 is an

58
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,319
okay move this is called the duras

59
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,120
Gambit I'm not sure that black knew that

60
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,519
I think black just was learning how to

61
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,400
move the pawns Joe plays D3 nice and

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
defensive he could have taken on F5 and

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
if he had taken on F5 the diagonal to

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,760
the king would have been wide open so

65
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,440
you've got to be very careful already as

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,959
black it's like very close to being

67
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,840
Checkmate so Joe plays defensively black

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
plays Pawn takes Pawn takes and is

69
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,319
immediately lost it took three moves you

70
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,040
know chest is hard but one thing you

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,640
will learn as a beginner is how not to

72
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,239
poop your pants within the first 10

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,800
moves this is very very important I

74
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,760
teach it in my book and today's video is

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
in fact

76
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,200
sponsored buy my book it's back there

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,599
how to win a chess it'll teach you

78
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,920
everything to not get this type of

79
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,799
position in the first three moves the

80
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,920
reason this is so bad is because now

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,799
this check is completely lethal and you

82
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,040
should always look for checks uh because

83
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,879
sometimes they're really good Queen H5

84
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,159
just wins the game black goes here Queen

85
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,440
E5 Bishop C4 and there's Checkmate on

86
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,239
the horizon here's Checkmate right away

87
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,480
uh but also there is G6 Queen E5 and you

88
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,959
would simply pick up a rook so you need

89
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,360
to always be able to look for checks

90
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,319
it's why you don't want to open up your

91
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,400
king early in the game but Joe is a

92
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,680
principal man plays Knight F3 developing

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,959
his Knight like he knows he should

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,720
Knight F6 develops both Knights Knights

95
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,439
before Bishops I love this by Mr Joseph

96
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,840
what an absolute Beast playing like a

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,760
Grandmaster to true to his name and now

98
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,480
black of course should Mirror Image

99
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,920
develop your Knights first but instead

100
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,519
black very active throws yet another

101
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,439
Pawn into the center of the board this

102
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,000
is simply a counting mistake all

103
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,840
beginners watching this can improve this

104
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,599
one skill counting is the skill in chess

105
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,400
when you count the amount of pieces that

106
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,400
can capture on a square or a piece right

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,760
square or a piece so this is one and

108
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,879
there's zero for black so that's why

109
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,319
black should have went D6 or this gotten

110
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,959
a piece to look at another piece another

111
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,360
good way to improve a chess think of

112
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,159
your pieces as having eyeballs Vision

113
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,440
all right this sees that this sees that

114
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
and this sees that so it is not a good

115
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,080
trade but damn it Joseph is a man of

116
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,560
principle and in the opening we tell

117
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,080
beginners not to make multiple moves

118
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,320
with pieces that they've already gotten

119
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,440
out so he moves his Bishop

120
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,840
he moves his Bishop cuz he knows he's

121
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,400
supposed to develop his pieces all right

122
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,759
unfortunately what it does for black is

123
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,880
that it leaves black with two Center

124
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,080
pawns and now black captures on e4 now

125
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,680
every time a pawn moves in chess or any

126
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,320
piece you got to think about what opens

127
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,039
up what things now see things they

128
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,960
didn't see before the queen has Vision

129
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,240
across the board you could go take take

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,120
Knight takes and threaten a fork but

131
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,840
instead of that sadly Joe here falls for

132
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,720
the common beginner mistake of having

133
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,000
tunnel vision and he takes the Pawn that

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,960
just landed on that square yet again a

135
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,680
counting mistake black has two things

136
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,720
that can see that pawn you only have one

137
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,600
and so after d takes E4 Knight takes E4

138
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,080
Joe realizes uhoh I just lost the

139
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,320
Knight and that is very common that is a

140
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,880
beginner mistake that is quite avoidable

141
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,400
and hopefully does not happen again he

142
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,880
saw the pawn he took it back and he went

143
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,039
damn it I lost my knight but now he

144
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,840
castles and now black finds a really

145
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,280
nice tactical idea here considering that

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,000
black just moved the night black

147
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,800
completely forgets that they have any

148
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,919
other pieces and they continue to move

149
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,960
the Knight forward losing it in one move

150
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,960
completely that move hangs a knight that

151
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,720
no questions asked so this is one thing

152
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,360
you should avoid as a beginner you

153
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,520
should avoid moving a piece and then

154
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,840
thinking you have to move it again that

155
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,880
is literally not the law at all I don't

156
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,440
know why you all think that way you have

157
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,080
other pieces and you've got to viol you

158
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,360
got to stop violating principles Knight

159
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,759
C3 played now this is a bad move

160
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,039
because you can just be taken joo's here

161
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:06,919
though I I don't really I don't

162
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,360
understand I I don't it it's standing on

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,880
the same line as the Queen the Knight

164
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,759
can now take the bishop black here

165
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,360
because they are up a knight because

166
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,160
they took the Knight should trade pieces

167
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,199
they they should trade the queen they

168
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,599
should trade the bishop and then they

169
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:19,919
got to get the king to safety because in

170
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,039
chess you need material and King safety

171
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,280
and you need to stop playing chess like

172
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,599
it's Russian Roulette I mean you're

173
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:26,720
basically like spinning the chest pieces

174
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,840
around and maybe some of them will fall

175
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,720
off the table black here plays a move

176
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,080
that's so high level I can't even begin

177
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,560
to understand it white moves the queen

178
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,599
to attack the Knight that could have

179
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,840
been taken black plays Bishop

180
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,240
B4 defending the knight from the queen

181
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,720
taking it but not from the pawn the pawn

182
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,000
can still absolutely take and Joe clutch

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,680
as ever does in fact find that move and

184
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,039
now that Bishop is hanging as

185
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,319
well so black moves the bishop all the

186
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,759
way to the home

187
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,680
Square why why not literally any other

188
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,000
Square literally any other Square was

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,479
better why would you put the pieces all

190
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,000
on the back rank now this position my

191
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,919
man Joe plays the powerful Rook to D1

192
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,240
and I think his idea was to take the

193
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,639
queen he kind of forgot the queen could

194
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,199
take him too friends enemies your queen

195
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,800
can't attack a queen that's not how that

196
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,440
works the cuz the queen could take you

197
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,960
you can't beat up yourself I mean I

198
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,240
guess you don't though all right Bishop

199
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,000
D7 powerful move uh White is now totally

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,599
winning that's mostly because the Knight

201
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,000
can take the pawn and the king is still

202
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,560
in the center uh but joo's here you know

203
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,280
what I don't hate this move 40 seconds

204
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
spent on this move maybe he was getting

205
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,400
the delivery food at the front door that

206
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,960
move attacks that pawn uh now two things

207
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,599
attack that pawn and The Rook pins the

208
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:51,919
bishop to the queen none of them know

209
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,159
any of that but yeah I'm just telling

210
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,280
you black goes here I love that

211
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,360
excellent excellent development now if

212
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,039
only the bishop was there you know if

213
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,440
only this was the position black would

214
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,800
be fine I mean black would be completely

215
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,479
lost but for 100 black is fine anyway

216
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,240
Queen E3 moves out of the way to attack

217
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,840
the pawn the pawn is now defended and

218
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,360
now rather than taking it Joe attacks it

219
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,440
yet again he really really wants to make

220
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,879
sure he can win this Pawn before he

221
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,400
takes it he's a meticulous guy you know

222
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,680
what they say uh measured twice caught

223
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
once or something I think that's what

224
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,759
they say in this position uh 16t plays

225
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,240
Bishop D6 which he could have played

226
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,880
here but but didn't all right but but

227
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,399
didn't I shouldn't say he by the way I

228
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,440
don't even know all right there's my see

229
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,880
that's that that's that subconscious you

230
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,479
know 90% 85% male audience I'm by the

231
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,279
way this channel is up to about 9010 at

232
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,600
the beginning of the chess boom I had

233
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,360
99% male audience which was wild that is

234
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,240
wild you you you lunatics and now now

235
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,480
it's like 891 now it's like 9010 so it's

236
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,399
gotten 10x bigger so uh Rook B5 all

237
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,600
right Rook B5 powerful move here here

238
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,839
attacks and threatens the pawn on B7 and

239
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,160
black plays the most logical move thus

240
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,440
far B6 pushing the pawn forward it is

241
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,399
defended three times one two three and

242
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,760
look at Joe look at this positional move

243
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,880
by Joe Queen up to E4 the idea of this

244
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,000
move is to put pressure on the Knight

245
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that was just weakened with the pawn

246
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,200
moving up you see Joe didn't want to

247
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,920
attack the Knight the Knight was

248
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,480
defended very well so he goes here and

249
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,320
now here this is excellent 187 ELO chess

250
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,079
excellent stuff plays A6 attacking The

251
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,720
Rook Rook goes back to D5 and now my man

252
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,000
Joe plays Bishop to G5 by the way I

253
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,839
think black here thought he was castling

254
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,800
I said I did it again black thought that

255
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
uh they were castling but instead they

256
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,240
moved the Rook to f8 or they just don't

257
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,480
know about castling but white did it so

258
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,519
they should do it too Joe plays Bishop

259
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,839
to G5 black plays Bishop to

260
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,760
E7 strong move defending yourself it's

261
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,519
again a completely lost position because

262
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,760
Black's completely stuck in the center

263
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,800
so the the winning idea here for white

264
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,040
is literally to rip open the position

265
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,600
and after Knight E5 Rook E5 you just

266
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,200
this is not a defendable position you

267
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,720
will take this you will take this it's

268
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,279
it's over but they don't know that

269
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,800
because they don't have the patterns yet

270
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,000
they they don't have it all Bishop B7

271
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,040
nowo plays Rook D1 which by the way is a

272
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,519
top computer move Rook D1 this is called

273
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,920
a battery onto the bishop if white were

274
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,399
to take they would get a bishop and a

275
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,440
queen they would get a bishop and black

276
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,279
would get both Rooks you do the math

277
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,079
Queen and Bishop is 12 two Rooks is 10

278
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,399
Queen and Bishop are always better um

279
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,279
black plays Bishop takes Bishop which is

280
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,079
a good move white plays Knight takes

281
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,760
Bishop because when you're 187 you

282
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,200
discover new things about the position

283
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,720
every single turn Queen takes G5 and at

284
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,839
this point Joe's 187 brain kicked in and

285
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,079
went there's a queen there which means

286
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:53,639
my king is in danger so I need to go

287
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,200
here no actually no no you don't none of

288
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,279
that even began to I don't even what's

289
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,560
the queen doing the first thing we got

290
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,320
to ask ourselves is can the queen take

291
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,839
anything it can but then I take back so

292
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,040
no need to go here can do I have a check

293
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,079
in this position yeah bad bad bad can I

294
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,440
take anything yeah free Bishop now you

295
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,600
got to realize you know you got back up

296
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
but Joe plays here safe safe move by Joe

297
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,839
and now black puts the queen back on the

298
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,920
home Square again black loves moving

299
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
pieces out and then moving them back to

300
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
the home Square I don't know what what

301
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
Black's purpose is but black moves the

302
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,480
queen out and a move later goes back to

303
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,880
the home SC now this move is still

304
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,959
completely crushing it is the best move

305
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,720
this is even better because you get to

306
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,480
the king and and Joe plays F4 not a bad

307
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,800
move at all don't hate that move you

308
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,200
can't take I don't know if Joe saw that

309
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,760
but he's he's PP on the pp here put

310
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,040
pressure on the pin piece now black here

311
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,639
plays a very powerful move Knight to D4

312
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,519
which hangs the Knight to the same Pawn

313
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,639
also it removes the defense of the E5

314
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,560
Pawn so now Rook E5 is completely

315
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
devastating

316
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,600
but Joe is a simple man and he see check

317
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,240
he play check it's a check you never

318
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,880
know what could happen right black has

319
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,800
to block block or move the king black

320
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,760
plays Rook F7 okay I mean you know at

321
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,920
least black didn't move the king a lot

322
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,120
of people think I'm in check I got to

323
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,040
move the king Black Blocks with the Rook

324
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,480
all right now Joe obviously takes the

325
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,600
Rook with the

326
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,440
bishop you know what Joe you're on to

327
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,240
something you took a pawn with Sheck now

328
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,320
you could take a knight you could take

329
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,480
the Rook you could also play Queen H7

330
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,079
Queen h8 is mate all right now we now

331
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,639
all right we took the Knight bless no

332
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,399
problem now Black Blocks it's still a

333
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,040
game in fact white is only a pawn up I

334
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,720
mean really this is this is very

335
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,480
complicated stuff Bishop goes back to E2

336
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,839
all right White's got a very powerful

337
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:40,880
position strong pressure here Bishop is

338
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,959
rotating around this way now black plays

339
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,240
the very mysterious Queen to B8 17

340
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,920
seconds spent on that move I would love

341
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,959
to get into the brain of a 166 and see

342
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,880
what neurons are firing for a move like

343
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,279
Queen to B8 to be played because it does

344
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,920
nothing but why did they play Queen B I

345
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,199
don't know fascinating stuff now Joe

346
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:01,880
plays F5 he's trying to attack the king

347
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,680
he doesn't realize again counting

348
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,519
exercise black controls that three times

349
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,839
but white is still in very good shape

350
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,560
because these pieces are out of the game

351
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,560
14 pieces of material are outside of the

352
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,000
battle just having a cigarette all right

353
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,199
Pawn takes

354
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:18,959
F5 all right and and now and now

355
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,399
unfortunately unfortunately 187 brain

356
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,600
kicks in white plays Rook takes F5 so

357
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,160
Joe's idea was to trade he

358
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,399
miscounts and luckily he doesn't go all

359
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,440
in sometimes as a beginner you just take

360
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,959
everything Joe resets and plays Queen E5

361
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,279
and you'll notice Joe here spent 18

362
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,519
seconds probably questioning why he ever

363
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,720
downloaded the chess.com app and now he

364
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,959
is down a full Rook but he still has

365
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,800
attacking possibilities the bishop could

366
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,920
still come here The Rook still has to

367
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,000
come here you got to set what's called a

368
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,600
mating net you got to make sure the king

369
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,120
can't escape over there uh black here

370
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,839
plays The Very powerful Bishop takes C2

371
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,639
winning yet another Pawn black now up

372
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,320
Five Points of material white plays Rook

373
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,800
D2 saving his rook and black again moves

374
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,920
the bishop he couldn't move it back to

375
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,680
the home Square Bishop

376
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,120
F5 and now I got to give credit where

377
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,360
it's zo because Joe never let up Joe in

378
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,800
this position could have just fallen

379
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,519
over and said you know what I'm going to

380
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,880
lose no Joe attacks G four and if we

381
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,320
know anything about our protagonist with

382
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,680
the black pieces they are going to move

383
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,240
the bishop to the

384
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,600
homes very close close but no cigar did

385
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,959
not move the bishop to the home square

386
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,560
but moved it very very close now if

387
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,680
you're playing white here you got to do

388
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,079
this but Joe a man of principle a man of

389
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,759
tunnel vision G4 H4 here we go and now

390
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,680
officially you are completely lost you

391
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,360
are completely lost here because black

392
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,560
should move the queen and trade Queens

393
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,480
white has no danger to the black

394
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,079
position with no Queen the queen is a

395
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,519
very powerful

396
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,720
piece instead of that black plays Rook

397
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,000
G7 now white is winning very close

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,240
Bishop C4 Rook F2 black has to find only

399
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,680
moves to survive Bishop C4 swarms the

400
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,600
king but with his Pawn threatened Joe

401
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,160
plays G5 five and black is yet again

402
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,759
winning if he brings his Queen to help

403
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:07,320
black plays H6 trying to fight back and

404
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,360
yet again Joe has to activate his bishop

405
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,519
and his Rook he's refusing to do so he's

406
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,040
not he finds Bishop C4 20 seconds spent

407
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,360
on this move absolutely clutch find Rook

408
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,000
F2 is basically mate the black king

409
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,320
completely stranded in the open H takes

410
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,519
G5 and Joe does not tunnel vision he

411
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,160
does not take back he plays Rook F2

412
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,279
Rook F2 check he's found it oh my

413
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,759
goodness the

414
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,120
187 and black can only block the check

415
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,399
until he is mated the King has no legal

416
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,120
moves and this is a lesson for why you

417
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,399
should not hide your queen in the corner

418
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,600
of the board in a bunker black plays

419
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,519
Rook F7 and the game is over Joe finds

420
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:51,079
Rook F7 King G8 and

421
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,440
queen okay Queen G7 was made Rook D7 won

422
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,360
a bishop and then was made Rook

423
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,519
G7 okay and now Joe plays Rook G6 all

424
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,759
right he could have taken the bishop

425
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,720
Rook G6 discovered check the only move

426
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,240
is King H7 and now Joe ends the game

427
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,600
with

428
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,800
Queen

429
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,759
okay okay um that's still made next

430
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:23,399
move there's an m in the evaluation

431
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,240
black literally cannot get out of

432
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,199
checkmate at all and what black should

433
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,040
be doing now is getting the queen in to

434
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,920
help black goes

435
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,319
here the idea I guess was to play

436
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,800
peekaboo that was the idea and then

437
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
you're G to go here you're gonna go

438
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,680
peekaboo and you're going to see all

439
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,079
this queen G queen queen G7 is mate Joe

440
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,480
doesn't find it Joe Joe respects the

441
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,279
threat of the queen and plays D5 he

442
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,560
blocks the Queen's Vision but this is

443
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,240
still made now Black's best hope here is

444
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,560
to get the rook in the game and he does

445
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,480
and now Queen G7 is no longer possible

446
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,279
possible instead you have to find that

447
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,120
check that check that check or one of

448
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,520
those checks you can't move your Rook

449
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,199
cuz you're pinned Joe clutch again finds

450
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,559
Bishop D3 check Black's only king move

451
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,439
is now moving up and queen F6 leads to

452
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,919
mate Rook G8 leads to mate in a few

453
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,360
moves and you win the rook and in this

454
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,679
position finally Joe finds Rook

455
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,400
to Rook takes G6

456
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,960
Bishop takes King

457
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,919
takes and Joe is

458
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,840
down a

459
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,960
bishop Queen and Bishop versus

460
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,200
queen he had so many chances and

461
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,799
unfortunately he found none of them this

462
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,960
is why we always have to practice

463
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,559
checkmates as a beginner you got to

464
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,720
drill mates in One you have to be a

465
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,520
killer at finding mateson one and then

466
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,400
you have to move on to mateson two all

467
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,080
right but instead of that Joe doesn't

468
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,400
find it Joe goes here pressure on the

469
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,600
clock he probably felt the nerves and

470
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,559
now he is

471
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,440
unfortunately going to lose this

472
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,120
game but then Joe saw a

473
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,679
light and in this position despite

474
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,080
having a Checkmate in one about 17

475
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,799
times Joe got a second Breath of Life he

476
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,320
played H5

477
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,120
and in this position Black's Queen is

478
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,799
stuck so black needs to bring the queen

479
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,440
around like a car that's parked in a

480
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,679
parking lot trade the Queens stop

481
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,559
White's Pawn Win the end game with their

482
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,960
pawns but black is rated

483
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,280
166 and after H5 is played for an

484
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,559
inexplicable reason black moves the king

485
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,120
back one square to f8 that move doesn't

486
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,159
even even begin to make sense doesn't

487
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,720
begin to make sense because if you have

488
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,640
these powerful pieces and you're not in

489
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,919
check you shouldn't move your king I

490
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:09,320
guess black thought this was a bishop

491
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,880
black goes here Joe continues pushing

492
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,960
and suddenly Joe goes from losing to

493
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,919
equal to winning because there is no way

494
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,400
for black to stop the pawns

495
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,840
geometrically the King goes to F7 and

496
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,280
now without even knowing it Joseph the

497
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,600
new subscriber to the channel played the

498
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,720
best computer move he just played H5 and

499
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,960
H6 what looks like the most natural move

500
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,360
in this position H7 but H7 loses a major

501
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,120
chunk of the advantage because the queen

502
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,559
can stop the pawn and if you go here

503
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,799
trying to get it through you might win

504
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,600
but if you make the wrong move black

505
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,799
survives so instead of that after

506
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,720
playing H5 and H6 Joseph played the move

507
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,679
Queen to G7 using his Pawn as an anchor

508
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,200
for his Queen Queen the black king

509
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,120
completely stuck he has to move to the

510
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,360
back rank Pawn to H7 and Joe made a

511
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,919
Monumental comeback in this game Queen

512
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,919
takes D5 he promoted a pawn and he

513
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,039
latter checkmated his opponent with his

514
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,600
two freshly mined

515
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,840
queens that was a

516
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,559
game between two 100 rated players I got

517
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,720
news for you 100 ELO is Elo hell because

518
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,640
these guys were not even that bad sure

519
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,960
Joe had 16 misses sure sure their

520
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,000
accuracy was 33.1 and

521
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,520
27.0 but

522
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,280
honestly that game was pretty

523
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,799
competitive both white and black missed

524
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,159
some chances in the opening the middle

525
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:52,600
game battle was fairly even White's

526
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,120
endgame Precision Was A Cut Above off

527
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,039
black there you

528
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,080
go shout out to Joe and shout out to

529
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,400
every new member of the Chess World we

530
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,039
all have to start somewhere and Joe is

531
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,600
already up to 350

532
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,159
rapid

533
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,559
so get out of here
