00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.320
ladies and gentlemen if you clicked on

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.480
this video I've got a very simple

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.080
message for you every single one of you

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.120
should try to be as strong as possible

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.440
at the game of chess and the reason for

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.880
that is very simple absolutely every

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.039
other person that you interact with will

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.160
respect you much more every other person

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.760
that you interact with will think that

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.960
you are an intellectual a sophisticated

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.759
form of human being now not that is

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.320
Justified but the game of chess is

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.399
falsely associated with intelligence and

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.800
the lowest form of this intelligence or

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.960
capability is 100 ELO the lowest

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.360
possible form of chest strength that a

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.480
person can

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.399
have and in today's video I will show

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.640
you a chess game played between two

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.480
individuals in the ELO range of

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.920
100 but one

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.280
caveat we all have to start somewhere

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.680
all of us have started Chess at some

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.720
point at a certain location on the

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.600
rating

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.840
scale this is a new subscriber by the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.520
name of Joe everybody say hi Joe he

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.880
didn't hear you because that's not the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.520
way the internet works but Joe will

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.119
definitely get a warm big welcome on

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.439
this channel what we do on this channel

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.880
what we do in this playlist called how

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.680
to lose a chess is we break games down

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.280
and the point is that we're not laughing

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.920
at Joe or his

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.560
opponent we are looking at a mirror

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.479
image reflection of ourselves see chz

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.240
has this way of exposing all of our

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.000
flaws of exposing our of exposing our

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
hubris our arrogance our lack of empathy

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.600
for other people we all need to look at

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.840
the mirror and remember get as strong as

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.200
possible in chess because everybody will

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.200
think more highly of you shout out to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.479
Joe for being brave enough to submit

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.079
this game let's break it down it is

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.799
187 versus 166 and Joe's opponent from

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.920
Austria named 16t has like a as a like a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.840
James Bond name he just the name is just

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.159
is James Bond here we go Joe begins with

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.960
E4 already a very good move we don't

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.799
have to wait long to get the action bang

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.840
in here 16t responds with Pawn to

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.000
F5 a very strong move all right Joe

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.160
plays

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.200
D3 that's fine you know he spent a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.920
little bit of time on that move D3 is an

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.319
okay move this is called the duras

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.120
Gambit I'm not sure that black knew that

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.519
I think black just was learning how to

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.400
move the pawns Joe plays D3 nice and

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.560
defensive he could have taken on F5 and

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.480
if he had taken on F5 the diagonal to

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.760
the king would have been wide open so

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.440
you've got to be very careful already as

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.959
black it's like very close to being

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.840
Checkmate so Joe plays defensively black

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.360
plays Pawn takes Pawn takes and is

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.319
immediately lost it took three moves you

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.040
know chest is hard but one thing you

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.640
will learn as a beginner is how not to

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.239
poop your pants within the first 10

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.800
moves this is very very important I

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.760
teach it in my book and today's video is

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.760
in fact

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.200
sponsored buy my book it's back there

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.599
how to win a chess it'll teach you

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.920
everything to not get this type of

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.799
position in the first three moves the

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.920
reason this is so bad is because now

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.799
this check is completely lethal and you

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.040
should always look for checks uh because

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.879
sometimes they're really good Queen H5

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.159
just wins the game black goes here Queen

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.440
E5 Bishop C4 and there's Checkmate on

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.239
the horizon here's Checkmate right away

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.480
uh but also there is G6 Queen E5 and you

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.959
would simply pick up a rook so you need

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.360
to always be able to look for checks

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.319
it's why you don't want to open up your

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.400
king early in the game but Joe is a

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.680
principal man plays Knight F3 developing

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.959
his Knight like he knows he should

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.720
Knight F6 develops both Knights Knights

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.439
before Bishops I love this by Mr Joseph

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.840
what an absolute Beast playing like a

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.760
Grandmaster to true to his name and now

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.480
black of course should Mirror Image

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.920
develop your Knights first but instead

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.519
black very active throws yet another

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.439
Pawn into the center of the board this

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.000
is simply a counting mistake all

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.840
beginners watching this can improve this

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.599
one skill counting is the skill in chess

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.400
when you count the amount of pieces that

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.400
can capture on a square or a piece right

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.760
square or a piece so this is one and

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.879
there's zero for black so that's why

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.319
black should have went D6 or this gotten

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.959
a piece to look at another piece another

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.360
good way to improve a chess think of

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.159
your pieces as having eyeballs Vision

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.440
all right this sees that this sees that

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.440
and this sees that so it is not a good

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.080
trade but damn it Joseph is a man of

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.560
principle and in the opening we tell

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.080
beginners not to make multiple moves

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.320
with pieces that they've already gotten

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.440
out so he moves his Bishop

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.840
he moves his Bishop cuz he knows he's

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.400
supposed to develop his pieces all right

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.759
unfortunately what it does for black is

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:38.880
that it leaves black with two Center

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.080
pawns and now black captures on e4 now

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.680
every time a pawn moves in chess or any

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.320
piece you got to think about what opens

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.039
up what things now see things they

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.960
didn't see before the queen has Vision

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.240
across the board you could go take take

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.120
Knight takes and threaten a fork but

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.840
instead of that sadly Joe here falls for

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.720
the common beginner mistake of having

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.000
tunnel vision and he takes the Pawn that

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.960
just landed on that square yet again a

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.680
counting mistake black has two things

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.720
that can see that pawn you only have one

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.600
and so after d takes E4 Knight takes E4

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.080
Joe realizes uhoh I just lost the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.320
Knight and that is very common that is a

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.880
beginner mistake that is quite avoidable

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.400
and hopefully does not happen again he

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.880
saw the pawn he took it back and he went

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.039
damn it I lost my knight but now he

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.840
castles and now black finds a really

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.280
nice tactical idea here considering that

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.000
black just moved the night black

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.800
completely forgets that they have any

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.919
other pieces and they continue to move

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.960
the Knight forward losing it in one move

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.960
completely that move hangs a knight that

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.720
no questions asked so this is one thing

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.360
you should avoid as a beginner you

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.520
should avoid moving a piece and then

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.840
thinking you have to move it again that

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.880
is literally not the law at all I don't

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.440
know why you all think that way you have

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.080
other pieces and you've got to viol you

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.360
got to stop violating principles Knight

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.759
C3 played now this is a bad move

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.039
because you can just be taken joo's here

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.919
though I I don't really I don't

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.360
understand I I don't it it's standing on

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.880
the same line as the Queen the Knight

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.759
can now take the bishop black here

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.360
because they are up a knight because

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.160
they took the Knight should trade pieces

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.199
they they should trade the queen they

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.599
should trade the bishop and then they

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:19.919
got to get the king to safety because in

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.039
chess you need material and King safety

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.280
and you need to stop playing chess like

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.599
it's Russian Roulette I mean you're

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.720
basically like spinning the chest pieces

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.840
around and maybe some of them will fall

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.720
off the table black here plays a move

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.080
that's so high level I can't even begin

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.560
to understand it white moves the queen

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.599
to attack the Knight that could have

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.840
been taken black plays Bishop

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.240
B4 defending the knight from the queen

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.720
taking it but not from the pawn the pawn

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.000
can still absolutely take and Joe clutch

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.680
as ever does in fact find that move and

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.039
now that Bishop is hanging as

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.319
well so black moves the bishop all the

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:53.759
way to the home

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.680
Square why why not literally any other

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.000
Square literally any other Square was

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.479
better why would you put the pieces all

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.000
on the back rank now this position my

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.919
man Joe plays the powerful Rook to D1

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:15.240
and I think his idea was to take the

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.639
queen he kind of forgot the queen could

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:21.199
take him too friends enemies your queen

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:23.800
can't attack a queen that's not how that

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.440
works the cuz the queen could take you

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.960
you can't beat up yourself I mean I

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.240
guess you don't though all right Bishop

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.000
D7 powerful move uh White is now totally

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.599
winning that's mostly because the Knight

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:39.000
can take the pawn and the king is still

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.560
in the center uh but joo's here you know

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.280
what I don't hate this move 40 seconds

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.560
spent on this move maybe he was getting

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.400
the delivery food at the front door that

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.960
move attacks that pawn uh now two things

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.599
attack that pawn and The Rook pins the

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:51.919
bishop to the queen none of them know

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.159
any of that but yeah I'm just telling

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:55.280
you black goes here I love that

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.360
excellent excellent development now if

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.039
only the bishop was there you know if

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.440
only this was the position black would

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.800
be fine I mean black would be completely

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.479
lost but for 100 black is fine anyway

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:06.240
Queen E3 moves out of the way to attack

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.840
the pawn the pawn is now defended and

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.360
now rather than taking it Joe attacks it

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.440
yet again he really really wants to make

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.879
sure he can win this Pawn before he

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:17.400
takes it he's a meticulous guy you know

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.680
what they say uh measured twice caught

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.680
once or something I think that's what

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.759
they say in this position uh 16t plays

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:28.240
Bishop D6 which he could have played

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.880
here but but didn't all right but but

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.399
didn't I shouldn't say he by the way I

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.440
don't even know all right there's my see

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.880
that's that that's that subconscious you

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.479
know 90% 85% male audience I'm by the

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.279
way this channel is up to about 9010 at

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:45.600
the beginning of the chess boom I had

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.360
99% male audience which was wild that is

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.240
wild you you you lunatics and now now

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.480
it's like 891 now it's like 9010 so it's

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.399
gotten 10x bigger so uh Rook B5 all

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:02.600
right Rook B5 powerful move here here

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.839
attacks and threatens the pawn on B7 and

00:09:04.839 --> 00:09:06.160
black plays the most logical move thus

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.440
far B6 pushing the pawn forward it is

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.399
defended three times one two three and

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.760
look at Joe look at this positional move

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.880
by Joe Queen up to E4 the idea of this

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.000
move is to put pressure on the Knight

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
that was just weakened with the pawn

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.200
moving up you see Joe didn't want to

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:22.920
attack the Knight the Knight was

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.480
defended very well so he goes here and

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.320
now here this is excellent 187 ELO chess

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.079
excellent stuff plays A6 attacking The

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:33.720
Rook Rook goes back to D5 and now my man

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.000
Joe plays Bishop to G5 by the way I

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.839
think black here thought he was castling

00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:40.800
I said I did it again black thought that

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.720
uh they were castling but instead they

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.240
moved the Rook to f8 or they just don't

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.480
know about castling but white did it so

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.519
they should do it too Joe plays Bishop

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:50.839
to G5 black plays Bishop to

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:53.760
E7 strong move defending yourself it's

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.519
again a completely lost position because

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.760
Black's completely stuck in the center

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.800
so the the winning idea here for white

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.040
is literally to rip open the position

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.600
and after Knight E5 Rook E5 you just

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.200
this is not a defendable position you

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.720
will take this you will take this it's

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.279
it's over but they don't know that

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:12.800
because they don't have the patterns yet

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.000
they they don't have it all Bishop B7

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.040
nowo plays Rook D1 which by the way is a

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.519
top computer move Rook D1 this is called

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:20.920
a battery onto the bishop if white were

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.399
to take they would get a bishop and a

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.440
queen they would get a bishop and black

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.279
would get both Rooks you do the math

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:29.079
Queen and Bishop is 12 two Rooks is 10

00:10:29.079 --> 00:10:31.399
Queen and Bishop are always better um

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:33.279
black plays Bishop takes Bishop which is

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:36.079
a good move white plays Knight takes

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:38.760
Bishop because when you're 187 you

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.200
discover new things about the position

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.720
every single turn Queen takes G5 and at

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.839
this point Joe's 187 brain kicked in and

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:49.079
went there's a queen there which means

00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:53.639
my king is in danger so I need to go

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:58.200
here no actually no no you don't none of

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.279
that even began to I don't even what's

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:01.560
the queen doing the first thing we got

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.320
to ask ourselves is can the queen take

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.839
anything it can but then I take back so

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:08.040
no need to go here can do I have a check

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.079
in this position yeah bad bad bad can I

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:13.440
take anything yeah free Bishop now you

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.600
got to realize you know you got back up

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.040
but Joe plays here safe safe move by Joe

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.839
and now black puts the queen back on the

00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:23.920
home Square again black loves moving

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.920
pieces out and then moving them back to

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.600
the home Square I don't know what what

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.200
Black's purpose is but black moves the

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.480
queen out and a move later goes back to

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.880
the home SC now this move is still

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.959
completely crushing it is the best move

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:36.720
this is even better because you get to

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.480
the king and and Joe plays F4 not a bad

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.800
move at all don't hate that move you

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.200
can't take I don't know if Joe saw that

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.760
but he's he's PP on the pp here put

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.040
pressure on the pin piece now black here

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.639
plays a very powerful move Knight to D4

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:54.519
which hangs the Knight to the same Pawn

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:56.639
also it removes the defense of the E5

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:58.560
Pawn so now Rook E5 is completely

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.560
devastating

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.600
but Joe is a simple man and he see check

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.240
he play check it's a check you never

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.880
know what could happen right black has

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.800
to block block or move the king black

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.760
plays Rook F7 okay I mean you know at

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.920
least black didn't move the king a lot

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.120
of people think I'm in check I got to

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.040
move the king Black Blocks with the Rook

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.480
all right now Joe obviously takes the

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.600
Rook with the

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.440
bishop you know what Joe you're on to

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.240
something you took a pawn with Sheck now

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.320
you could take a knight you could take

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.480
the Rook you could also play Queen H7

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.079
Queen h8 is mate all right now we now

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:28.639
all right we took the Knight bless no

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.399
problem now Black Blocks it's still a

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:33.040
game in fact white is only a pawn up I

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.720
mean really this is this is very

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.480
complicated stuff Bishop goes back to E2

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.839
all right White's got a very powerful

00:12:38.839 --> 00:12:40.880
position strong pressure here Bishop is

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.959
rotating around this way now black plays

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:46.240
the very mysterious Queen to B8 17

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.920
seconds spent on that move I would love

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.959
to get into the brain of a 166 and see

00:12:49.959 --> 00:12:51.880
what neurons are firing for a move like

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.279
Queen to B8 to be played because it does

00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:56.920
nothing but why did they play Queen B I

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.199
don't know fascinating stuff now Joe

00:12:59.199 --> 00:13:01.880
plays F5 he's trying to attack the king

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.680
he doesn't realize again counting

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.519
exercise black controls that three times

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:07.839
but white is still in very good shape

00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:09.560
because these pieces are out of the game

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.560
14 pieces of material are outside of the

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.000
battle just having a cigarette all right

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.199
Pawn takes

00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:18.959
F5 all right and and now and now

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:21.399
unfortunately unfortunately 187 brain

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:23.600
kicks in white plays Rook takes F5 so

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.160
Joe's idea was to trade he

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.399
miscounts and luckily he doesn't go all

00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:31.440
in sometimes as a beginner you just take

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.959
everything Joe resets and plays Queen E5

00:13:33.959 --> 00:13:36.279
and you'll notice Joe here spent 18

00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:38.519
seconds probably questioning why he ever

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:40.720
downloaded the chess.com app and now he

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.959
is down a full Rook but he still has

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:44.800
attacking possibilities the bishop could

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.920
still come here The Rook still has to

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.000
come here you got to set what's called a

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.600
mating net you got to make sure the king

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.120
can't escape over there uh black here

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.839
plays The Very powerful Bishop takes C2

00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:55.639
winning yet another Pawn black now up

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:58.320
Five Points of material white plays Rook

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.800
D2 saving his rook and black again moves

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.920
the bishop he couldn't move it back to

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.680
the home Square Bishop

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.120
F5 and now I got to give credit where

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.360
it's zo because Joe never let up Joe in

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.800
this position could have just fallen

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.519
over and said you know what I'm going to

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:15.880
lose no Joe attacks G four and if we

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.320
know anything about our protagonist with

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.680
the black pieces they are going to move

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.240
the bishop to the

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.600
homes very close close but no cigar did

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.959
not move the bishop to the home square

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:26.560
but moved it very very close now if

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.680
you're playing white here you got to do

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.079
this but Joe a man of principle a man of

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:33.759
tunnel vision G4 H4 here we go and now

00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:35.680
officially you are completely lost you

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.360
are completely lost here because black

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.560
should move the queen and trade Queens

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.480
white has no danger to the black

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.079
position with no Queen the queen is a

00:14:43.079 --> 00:14:44.519
very powerful

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:46.720
piece instead of that black plays Rook

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.000
G7 now white is winning very close

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.240
Bishop C4 Rook F2 black has to find only

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.680
moves to survive Bishop C4 swarms the

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.600
king but with his Pawn threatened Joe

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.160
plays G5 five and black is yet again

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.759
winning if he brings his Queen to help

00:15:04.759 --> 00:15:07.320
black plays H6 trying to fight back and

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.360
yet again Joe has to activate his bishop

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.519
and his Rook he's refusing to do so he's

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:16.040
not he finds Bishop C4 20 seconds spent

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.360
on this move absolutely clutch find Rook

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.000
F2 is basically mate the black king

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.320
completely stranded in the open H takes

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.519
G5 and Joe does not tunnel vision he

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:29.160
does not take back he plays Rook F2

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.279
Rook F2 check he's found it oh my

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:32.759
goodness the

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:36.120
187 and black can only block the check

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.399
until he is mated the King has no legal

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:40.120
moves and this is a lesson for why you

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.399
should not hide your queen in the corner

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:43.600
of the board in a bunker black plays

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.519
Rook F7 and the game is over Joe finds

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:51.079
Rook F7 King G8 and

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.440
queen okay Queen G7 was made Rook D7 won

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.360
a bishop and then was made Rook

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.519
G7 okay and now Joe plays Rook G6 all

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:06.759
right he could have taken the bishop

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:08.720
Rook G6 discovered check the only move

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.240
is King H7 and now Joe ends the game

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.600
with

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.800
Queen

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.759
okay okay um that's still made next

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:23.399
move there's an m in the evaluation

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:25.240
black literally cannot get out of

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.199
checkmate at all and what black should

00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:29.040
be doing now is getting the queen in to

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.920
help black goes

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.319
here the idea I guess was to play

00:16:34.319 --> 00:16:36.800
peekaboo that was the idea and then

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.800
you're G to go here you're gonna go

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.680
peekaboo and you're going to see all

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.079
this queen G queen queen G7 is mate Joe

00:16:43.079 --> 00:16:45.480
doesn't find it Joe Joe respects the

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.279
threat of the queen and plays D5 he

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:50.560
blocks the Queen's Vision but this is

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.240
still made now Black's best hope here is

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.560
to get the rook in the game and he does

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.480
and now Queen G7 is no longer possible

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.279
possible instead you have to find that

00:17:00.279 --> 00:17:03.120
check that check that check or one of

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.520
those checks you can't move your Rook

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.199
cuz you're pinned Joe clutch again finds

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:11.559
Bishop D3 check Black's only king move

00:17:11.559 --> 00:17:14.439
is now moving up and queen F6 leads to

00:17:14.439 --> 00:17:15.919
mate Rook G8 leads to mate in a few

00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:18.360
moves and you win the rook and in this

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:24.679
position finally Joe finds Rook

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.400
to Rook takes G6

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.960
Bishop takes King

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.919
takes and Joe is

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:37.840
down a

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.960
bishop Queen and Bishop versus

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.200
queen he had so many chances and

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.799
unfortunately he found none of them this

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:48.960
is why we always have to practice

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.559
checkmates as a beginner you got to

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:52.720
drill mates in One you have to be a

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.520
killer at finding mateson one and then

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.400
you have to move on to mateson two all

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.080
right but instead of that Joe doesn't

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.400
find it Joe goes here pressure on the

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.600
clock he probably felt the nerves and

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.559
now he is

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:10.440
unfortunately going to lose this

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.120
game but then Joe saw a

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.679
light and in this position despite

00:18:18.679 --> 00:18:22.080
having a Checkmate in one about 17

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.799
times Joe got a second Breath of Life he

00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:30.320
played H5

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.120
and in this position Black's Queen is

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.799
stuck so black needs to bring the queen

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:40.440
around like a car that's parked in a

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.679
parking lot trade the Queens stop

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:46.559
White's Pawn Win the end game with their

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:49.960
pawns but black is rated

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.280
166 and after H5 is played for an

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.559
inexplicable reason black moves the king

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:58.120
back one square to f8 that move doesn't

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.159
even even begin to make sense doesn't

00:19:01.159 --> 00:19:02.720
begin to make sense because if you have

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.640
these powerful pieces and you're not in

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.919
check you shouldn't move your king I

00:19:06.919 --> 00:19:09.320
guess black thought this was a bishop

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.880
black goes here Joe continues pushing

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.960
and suddenly Joe goes from losing to

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.919
equal to winning because there is no way

00:19:16.919 --> 00:19:18.400
for black to stop the pawns

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.840
geometrically the King goes to F7 and

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.280
now without even knowing it Joseph the

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.600
new subscriber to the channel played the

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.720
best computer move he just played H5 and

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.960
H6 what looks like the most natural move

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.360
in this position H7 but H7 loses a major

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.120
chunk of the advantage because the queen

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.559
can stop the pawn and if you go here

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:43.799
trying to get it through you might win

00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:46.600
but if you make the wrong move black

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.799
survives so instead of that after

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:53.720
playing H5 and H6 Joseph played the move

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.679
Queen to G7 using his Pawn as an anchor

00:19:57.679 --> 00:19:59.200
for his Queen Queen the black king

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.120
completely stuck he has to move to the

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.360
back rank Pawn to H7 and Joe made a

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.919
Monumental comeback in this game Queen

00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:10.919
takes D5 he promoted a pawn and he

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:13.039
latter checkmated his opponent with his

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:16.600
two freshly mined

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:22.840
queens that was a

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.559
game between two 100 rated players I got

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:32.720
news for you 100 ELO is Elo hell because

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.640
these guys were not even that bad sure

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.960
Joe had 16 misses sure sure their

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.000
accuracy was 33.1 and

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.520
27.0 but

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.280
honestly that game was pretty

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.799
competitive both white and black missed

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:51.159
some chances in the opening the middle

00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:52.600
game battle was fairly even White's

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.120
endgame Precision Was A Cut Above off

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.039
black there you

00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:59.080
go shout out to Joe and shout out to

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.400
every new member of the Chess World we

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.039
all have to start somewhere and Joe is

00:21:04.039 --> 00:21:07.600
already up to 350

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.159
rapid

00:21:09.159 --> 00:21:13.559
so get out of here
